# nextcord-pretty-help

A Nextcord compatible form of [stroupbslayen's discord-pretty-help project](https://github.com/stroupbslayen/discord-pretty-help/), which is an embed-based version of the built in `help` command for projects using discord.py. 

The output is inspired by the `DefaultHelpCommand` that discord.py uses, but is revised to use Discord embeds instead of plain text, and additional sorting on paginated sections that can be "scrolled" through using reactions.

## Installation

`pip install nextcord-pretty-help`

## Usage

Example of how to use it:

```python
from nextcord.ext import commands
from pretty_help import PrettyHelp

client = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", help_command=PrettyHelp())
```



### Added Optional Args

- `color` - Set the default embed color
- `ending_note` - Set the footer of the embed. Ending notes are fed a `commands.Context` (`ctx`) and a `PrettyHelp` (`help`) instance for more advanced customization.
- `index_title` - Set the index page name default is *"Categories"*
- `menu` - set a custom menu for navigating pages. Uses a `pretty_help.PrettyMenu()` instance. Default is `pretty_help.DefaultMenu()`
- `no_category` - Set the name of the page with commands not part of a category. Default is "*No Category*"
- `sort_commands` - Sort commands and categories alphabetically
- `show_index` - Show the index page or not

### pretty_help.DefaultHelp args

- `active_time` - Set the time (in seconds) that the message will be active. Default is 30s
- `delete_after_timeout` - Delete the message after `active_time` instead of removing reactions. Default `False`
- `page_left` - The emoji to use to page left
- `page_right` - The emoji to use to page right
- `remove` - The emoji to use to remove the help message


By default, the help will just pick a random color on every invoke. You can change this using the `color` argument:

```python

from nextcord.ext import commands
from pretty_help import DefaultMenu, PrettyHelp

# ":discord:743511195197374563" is a custom discord emoji format. Adjust to match your own custom emoji.
menu = DefaultMenu(page_left="\U0001F44D", page_right="ðŸ‘Ž", remove=":discord:743511195197374563", active_time=5)

# Custom ending note
ending_note = "The ending note from {ctx.bot.user.name}\nFor command {ctx.clean_prefix}{ctx.invoked_with}"

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

bot.help_command = PrettyHelp(menu=menu, ending_note=ending_note)
```

The basic `help` command will break commands up by cogs. Each cog will be a different page. Those pages can be navigated with
the arrow embeds. The message is unresponsive after 30s of no activity, it'll remove the reactions to let you know.

# Changelog

## [1.3.3]
- Added `delete_after_timeout` kwarg so messages are deleted after the time limit instead of just removing emojis
- Added command cooldown information to pages



# Notes:
- Nextcord must already be installed to use this
- `manage-messages` permission is recommended so reactions can be removed automatically
